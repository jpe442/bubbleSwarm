## Background and Overview

bubbleSwarm is a simple click/tap game in which bubbles of various sizes bounce around a screen for a given amount of time. "Popping" certain bubbles awards the player with points, with some bubbles being worth more than others. Some bubbles deduct points. The goal is to attain the highest score possible within the given time allotment. Bubbles shrink in size once a level is complete, causing the game to get that much more difficult as a side-effect.

The game leverages the intrinsic satisfaction of popping a bubble and simple pleasant visual experience, to create an easy-to-play and highly replayable strategy/dexterity clicker game. 

## Functionality & MVP

bubbleSort features:

  - 

 Create asteroids of custom size, color, and velocity vector
 Hear sounds on collisions
 Randomly seed the initial state for demoing or exploration purposes
 Start, pause, restart, and reset the simulation
 Select from a list of 'instruments' that will serve as the bases for sound events.
 
 In addition, this project will include:

 An About modal describing the basic functionality
 A Details modal delving into the specific implementation of Markov chains

## Implementation Timeline

  -Over the weekend: Went back over asteroids to reacquaint with the implementation of a basic physics framework and HTML 5 Canvas.

  -Day 1: Bubbles bouncing, shrink(enlarge) effect

  -Day 2: Tune gravity, click to destroy

  -Day 3: Points and "stage"/"game-over" rules

  -Day 4: Final styling and other final aesthetic touches

  -Bonus Features:

    + special effect bubbles (spread-effect, flash-effect)
    + simple sound effects (bubble popping, etc...)
    + speed adjustment slider
    + physics adjustment slider
    + number of bubbles at once slider
